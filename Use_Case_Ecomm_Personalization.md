# 🛒 Use Case: AI-Powered Product Recommendations (E-commerce)

## 📌 Problem Statement
E-commerce platforms often suffer from **high bounce rates** and **low product discoverability**, especially for new users. Customers frequently abandon the site because they feel overwhelmed by irrelevant choices or are unable to quickly find what they need.

## 🎯 Target Audience
- First-time users with no purchase history
- Returning users with diverse interests
- High-intent shoppers navigating quickly

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Implement an **AI-powered personalization engine** that dynamically recommends products based on:
- Past browsing/purchase behavior
- Demographics and location
- Popular items among similar users (collaborative filtering)

This personalization should reflect in:
- Homepage feed
- Product listing pages (PLP)
- Cart page cross-sell
- Email/push notifications

## 📈 Business Impact
- 📉 Reduce bounce rate by 15–20%
- 🛒 Improve conversion rate by 12–15%
- 🧠 Increase user session duration and product impressions
- 💰 Boost average order value (AOV) via relevant cross-selling

## 📊 KPIs to Track
- Click-Through Rate (CTR) on recommendations
- Conversion Rate of recommended items
- Average Session Duration
- Bounce Rate
- Repeat Visitor Engagement Score

## 🛠 Feasibility Snapshot
- Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, BigQuery, Google Recommendations AI or AWS Personalize
- Initial MVP can be deployed using simple rule-based logic before full ML integration

## 🔍 Competitive Benchmark
- Flipkart & Amazon: "Inspired by your browsing"
- Nykaa: Personalized carousel based on search history
